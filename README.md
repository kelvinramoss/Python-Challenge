# Python Challenge - Module 3
_The objective of this project is to apply the knowledge acquired in class using the Python programming language through two analyzes based on real situations. At the end of the analysis, export the data and results obtained in a text file._

## PyBank 

_The goal of this challenge is to create a Phyton scrpt to analyze the financial records of PyBank company. This analysis must The total number of months included in the dataset_
1. _The total number of months included in the dataset_

2. _The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period_

4. _The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period_

 5. _The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period_

## PyPoll

_The goal of this challenge is to create a Phyton script to assist a small and rural town to modernize its vote-counting process in order to optmize it. The analysis must have the following:_
